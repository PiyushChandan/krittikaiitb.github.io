# Official Website of Krittika

## To make a new Event post:
* Add the markdown file to the folder `eventsMarkdown`. The name of the file will be the url of the page (as in the url of astromania.md is https://krittikaiitb.github.io/events/astromania/)
* Add any images to the folder `public/img/blogsAndEvents/{nameOfMDFile}/`
* In the markdown, for theimages set the source url as `/img/blogsAndEvents/{nameOfMDFile}/{imgName}#eventImg`. See the astromania article if in doubt.
* If you want to change the css for the images, edit the file `styles/events.css`
