Krittika’s flagship event - Astromania - is the Annual Astronomy Quiz conducted for members of IIT Bombay. But it’s not your average quiz; it’s a battle of the celestials as they contest through an extra-terrestrial obstacle course of quiz rounds. It’s an opportunity to test your knowledge, expand your horizons, win exciting prizes and most importantly, explore the universe as you traverse through the competition.

The general aim of the event is to introduce astronomy and astrophysics to an audience consisting mainly of beginners to the field, in a way that encourages interaction among the teams as well as in the audience. Anyone stands a chance to become the ‘star’ of the show - even beginners! Every question of the competition is riddled with several fun ‘easter eggs’ and clues to bring out the master reasoner in you. Astromania comprises two rounds - the Preliminary Round and the Finals. The Finals generally present 5 sub-rounds that not only test your knowledge but also challenge your creativity through innovative rounds including memes and scientific inaccuracies. The winners are awarded amazing prizes to help launch their journey into the universe of astronomy.

Astromania has always been a grand event conducted by Krittika, and the Covid-19 lockdown did not destroy its grandeur. Even online, Astromania shone bright, luring the attention of a large number of students and staff members for two consecutive years. Engaging and interactive platforms such as Kahoot! and discord added to the user experience and further enhanced the event.
